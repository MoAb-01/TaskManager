# Task Manager Console Application

## Description

A simple Task Manager Console Application built using C# to manage tasks with features like adding, viewing, and deleting tasks. Tasks are stored persistently in a text file so that even after closing and reopening the application, the tasks remain saved.

## Features

- **Add a Task**: Enter a task title, description, and completion status (true/false).
- **View Tasks**: List all saved tasks with details such as title, description, and completion status.
- **Delete a Task**: Remove a task by selecting its index from the task list.

## Requirements

- .NET Core SDK to run the application.
- A code editor like Visual Studio.
